armDNA: A functional beta model for detecting age-related genomewide DNA methylation marks

Because DNA methylation (mDNA) plays an important role in many complex diseases and it is a dynamic process involving time,  it is important to identify age-related mDNA marks. The R package armDNA is designed to detect age-related mDNA marks using mDNA data obtained through the widely used bisulfite conversion technique, which allows for a nonparametric age effect and adjusts for potentially confounded covariates.
